Design Patterns in python 3.*

# SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design:
S - Single Responsibility : class should have only one responsibility  \n
O -  Open/Closed : A class should be open for extension usually by inheritance but closed for modifications \n
L - Liskov Substitution : Subclasses should be able to stand in for their parents in a program without breaking anything \n
I - Interface Segregation : many specific interfaces are better than one do-it-all interface. \n
D -  Dependency Inversion : we should program towards abstraction, not implementations. Implementations can vary, abstractions should not  \n
